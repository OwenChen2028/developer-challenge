## Deployed Application
TBD â€“ working on it

## Tools Used
- Unity (2019 LTS for faster compile times, though I normally work in a newer version)
- Unity Version Control (aka Plastic SCM)
- Visual Studio (for coding)
- GIMP (for drawing the sprites)

## Description
A simple 2D top-down shooter inspired by games I used to make and play when I was younger.  
Includes two enemy types, a boss, two power-ups, a health bar, and an enemy spawning system.  
I focused primarily on gameplay polish and code modularity.

## Learning Journey
I made this to re-learn how to build a project from scratch on my own.  
In my current research program, I work on a large VR project with extensive systems and tooling.  
This project helped me get back into 2D Unity development and refresh my knowledge of the animation system, which I usually leave to the digital artists on my team.  
I ran into various bugs related to running multiple coroutines, which are not used often in the work I normally do, and came away with a better understanding of how to manage them properly.

## Screenshots / Demo
TBD
